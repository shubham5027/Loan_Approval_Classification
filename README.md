Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can help financial institutions make informed decisions on loan applications. By analyzing historical loan application data and building a machine learning model, we aim to predict whether a new loan application should be approved or denied.

This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to create a robust and accurate classification model.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory. It includes various attributes related to loan applications, including personal information, financial details, and loan status (approved or denied). The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set for model development and evaluation.

Use the Python scripts in the src/ directory for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing and model training.

Models
We have trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models for loan approval classification. The model files and their details can be found in the models/ directory.

Evaluation
Model performance and evaluation metrics are discussed in the Jupyter notebooks and can be found in the notebooks/ directory. The main evaluation metrics considered include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
